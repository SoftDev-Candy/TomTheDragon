**Tom The Dragon**
Tom The Dragon is a fun, cozy 3D platformer created as part of a Futuregames project, built by a team of 21 students collaborating across India, Turkey, Sweden, and Warsaw. It was my first time working on a game with a team this large, and it taught me a lot about communication, managing time, and writing code that fits into someone else’s vision not just my own.

The game was built in Unity using C#. I mainly worked on:

**🟢 My contributions**
Player Movement Script – I handled the core movement for Tom, making sure the controls felt responsive and fun for younger players. A lot of time went into fine-tuning the jump, glide, and movement speed so it felt smooth and easy to learn.
Gameplay Elements – I worked on small but important interactions in the world, such as the lava smoke effects and some environmental logic that reacts to the rising lava.
Team Collaboration – I had to read and extend other people’s scripts, follow shared coding conventions, and adapt based on feedback from designers and artists. This helped me grow a lot as a programmer.

**About the Game**
Tom The Dragon is a light-hearted platformer aimed at kids aged 7–11. You play as Tom, a curious little dragon trying to escape from a rising sea of lava. The idea is simple: keep climbing higher while collecting power-ups and avoiding obstacles.

During the climb, players can:
Bounce on mushrooms for extra height
Dodge rocks thrown by mole miners
Use blue flowers for speed boosts
Use yellow flowers for super jumps
Explore colorful, friendly environments
The higher you climb, the more intense (and fun) it gets!
